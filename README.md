# KNN Income Classification – IBM SkillBuild Internship

This project was developed as part of the **IBM SkillBuild AI/ML Internship**. It uses the UCI Adult Census Dataset to predict whether a person earns more than $50K per year based on their demographic attributes using the **K-Nearest Neighbors** algorithm.

## 🔍 Problem Statement
To build a classification model that can determine income category (<=50K or >50K) using features like age, education, hours worked per week, etc.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python (Google Colab)
- Pandas, Numpy
- Scikit-learn (KNN)
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 📊 Project Steps
1. Upload dataset
2. Clean & encode data
3. Train-Test Split
4. KNN Training
5. Accuracy & Confusion Matrix
6. Accuracy vs K Plot

## ✅ Results
- Accuracy: ~83%
- Good classification of income groups
- Accuracy tuned using different K values

## 📈 Future Scope
- Deploy model as a web app using Streamlit
- Add feature scaling (standardization)
- Compare KNN with SVM, Logistic Regression, etc.
